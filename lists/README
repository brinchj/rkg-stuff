* Adding users to the list
> Create a list data file, that contains the names on your new list.

Ernest Hemingway
Elizabeth Hadley Richardson
Pauline Pfeiffer
Martha Gellhorn
Mary Welsh Hemingway


* Convert your input data to a JSON-encoded file
> This can be achieved using the script "gen-json.py" like so:
./gen-json.py > data/russere.json


* Generate a template for your list
> Templates are written in the Cheetah template language (Google it!)
> Available variables are the list $ps, that contains all persons.
> The following piece of HTML prints a list of all names:
<HTML><BODY>
<UL>
#for p in $ps
<LI>$p.name</LI>
#end for
</UL>
</BODY></HTML>

> Templates are located in the "templates" directory (look there for more examples).


* Build your template
> This is done using the script "build.sh" like so:
./build.sh LIST_NAME JSON_FILES

> Example:
./build.sh hemingway_family data/hemingway.json data/hemingway_wifes.json

> The above example uses the template "templates/hemingway_family.tmpl"
> HTML output is located in "html/hemingway_family.tmpl"
> PDF  output is located in "compiled/hemingway_family.pdf"
